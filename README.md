# üåê Voice Assistant in Python
Gapusya is a voice assistant designed to execute various commands using STT (Speech-to-Text) and TTS (Text-to-Speech) technologies. It operates offline and does not require connection to cloud services.<br />
The goal of the project is to create a local voice assistant capable of performing various tasks, such as creating notes, playing music, checking the weather, and much more, relying solely on local resources.<br />
# Key Features of the Project:
**Works Offline:** However, an internet connection is required for executing commands related to Wikipedia searches and weather data retrieval.<br />
**No Data Collection:** All data remains on your device without being sent to the cloud.
The project is written in Python using various libraries for speech recognition, speech synthesis, and working with internet resources.
# Technology Stack
**Speech Recognition:**  Vosk (a local speech recognition engine)<br />
**Speech Synthesis (TTS):** pyttsx3 (a local speech synthesizer)<br />
**Command Processing**: A command dictionary based on keywords using Python. <br />
**Wikipedia Information Search**: wikipedia library for searching Wikipedia. <br />
**Weather Retrieval via OpenWeather API**: for obtaining weather information.<br /> 

# Architecture and Code Description
**main.py** ‚Äî the main program file. Here, an instance of the assistant is created, and the main loop for processing commands is launched.<br />
**commands.py** ‚Äî a file with command settings, where keywords for various commands are defined.<br />
**network.py** ‚Äî a file for interacting with external services, such as Wikipedia search, weather retrieval, and web search <br />

**Code Example:**
```
def get_weather(self, city):
    open_weather_token = os.getenv("OPEN_WEATHER_TOKEN")
    if not open_weather_token:
        return "–û—à–∏–±–∫–∞: –Ω–µ –∑–∞–¥–∞–Ω —Ç–æ–∫–µ–Ω –¥–ª—è OpenWeather."
    try:
        r = requests.get(f"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city}&appid={open_weather_token}&units=metric&lang=ru")
        data = r.json()
        if data.get("cod") != 200:
            return f"–û—à–∏–±–∫–∞: {data.get('message', '–Ω–µ —É–¥–∞–ª–æ—Å—å –ø–æ–ª—É—á–∏—Ç—å –¥–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –æ –ø–æ–≥–æ–¥–µ')}."
        temp = data["main"]["temp"]
        feels_like = data["main"]["feels_like"]
        weather = data["weather"][0]["description"]
        return f"–°–µ–π—á–∞—Å –≤ –≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥–µ {city}: {weather}, —Ç–µ–º–ø–µ—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Ä–∞ {temp}¬∞C, –æ—â—É—â–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è –∫–∞–∫ {feels_like}¬∞C."
    except Exception as e:
        return f"–û—à–∏–±–∫–∞ –ø—Ä–∏ –ø–æ–ª—É—á–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –¥–∞–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –æ –ø–æ–≥–æ–¥–µ: {e}"
```
# Usage
### Setting up a virtual environment and running the program

1. Create a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies.
   Use the command:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
3. Set up your OpenWeather API key in a .env file:
  ```bash
   OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```


4. Run the program with the command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
